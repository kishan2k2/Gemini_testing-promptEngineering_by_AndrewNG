2. Brainstorm about the various Ideas, products, or applications I can make with Gemini and lang chain, integrating my web dev skills and learning Django.
3. Though that is a risky bet, I mean I know nothing about all of them.
4. Smart ATS using llama index
    1. i.e. I can parse the resumes and find the perfect candidate to hire. 
5. Just see the llama index repository get an idea and make some of your own.
6. Use of rag for photo editing.

7. Do llama index or long-chain right after this.
8. Play with the temperature and all.
9. Further research on how is the chathistory maintained.
    1. In the form of a list i.e. bulking up or what?

# Experience.

1. What if I change the safety settings, Can it do crazy things?
2. LLM model learns from their chat history.
    1. Explicit content ahead.
    2. I first asked about rape, it gave me a very elaborate response.
    3. Then I asked how to do rape, it blocked the response for me.
    4. Then again I asked about rape, And now it gave me a very short and diplomatic answer that it couldnâ€™t answer me.
3.
